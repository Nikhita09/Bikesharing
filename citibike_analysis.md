# Bikesharing

This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data and Des Moines city data which will help convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.

## Analysis

1. Population Comparison 

The popupaltion of NYC is far greater than the population in Des Moines. Des Moines has only 2.5% of NYC population. This would mean that the market size is far lesser and we would require fewer number of bikes available for rides. 
Des Moines is also smaller in terms of area (26%) which means it would be easier to get around in bikes in Des Moines than in NYC.
  
2. Age-wise breakup

After looking at the overall population, we can now breakdown the population by age. Here we can see that there is no significant difference between Des Moines and NYC in terms of age groups. 
This is a good sign as we can observe in the NYC data that the trip duration increases as age decreases.

3. Gender breakup

Another demographic to consider would be the gender. From the NYC data we can see that predominantly the users are Male.
The gender breakup of Des Moines and NYC are similar and do not have any significant difference.

4. Median Household income - Des Moines vs NYC

The median household income in NYC is 38% greater than Des Moines. Since we do not have the pricing data we cannot analyse the relationship between income and number of users, but assuming that bikesharing would cost less than car/gas/public transport in terms of both money and convenience, we could capture a larger market in Des Moines.

5. Trip duration metrics

After comparing demographics, we can now look at who uses the bikes more. We can see that male users have higher trip durations. We can also see that subscribers use the bikes more than customers.
We can use this data to come up with marketing strategies to pull in more female users and methods to entice customers to become subscribers.

6. Peak Hours

Now that we know who is using the bikesharing service more, we can look at how it is being used. Here we can see that the peak hours are at 8:00am in the morning and 5:00 pm in the evening. This coincided with work/school hours. This lets us know when we need to keep the bikes available so that there is no shortage of supply when demand is high.

7. Most popular starting and ending locations

The main city and tourist destinations in NYC see a lot of activity. Des Moines has lot of tourist attractions (https://www.catchdesmoines.com/things-to-do/) and hence there is a target group for the bike sharing services.

Therefore we can see that starting a bike-sharing program in Des Moines would be a good idea.
